# Dotfiles
This repo contains all of my most up-to date dotfiles including for various shells, Vim, etc. I use it whenever I first log onto 
a new system to make sure my configs are how I like them. Quite convenient to just get this repo and be able to symlink.

## Why is it "pub_dotfiles" rather than "dotfiles"?
There was a point during college when I was spent a lot of time trying to create all of these customized/complicates 
dotfiles for my terminal and Vim. This required a lot of experimentation and a lot of different versions of files.
This led to the original repo being quite messy but I didn't want to delete all of the different versions of these files.
Hence, this much cleaner repo with my very minimal dotfiles that is very convenient when setting up shop in new systems.
